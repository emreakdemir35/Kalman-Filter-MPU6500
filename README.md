# Kalman-Filter-MPU6500
A lightweight, C++ Kalman filter library designed for pitch, roll, and yaw estimation using only 6-axis IMU data (accelerometer + gyroscope). Optimized for STM32 microcontrollers running at high sampling rates (4 kHz), making it suitable for rockets, drones, or real-time embedded systems.
